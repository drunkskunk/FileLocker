# FileLocker
Encrypts your file and emails your password
File Locker is a software written intirely in java.It's a platform where we can encrypt a file so that no one can view or disclose any secret/authorised content.It also has an added feature where the user can email the password directly to an authorized e-mail(only gmail-as of now).
i have uploaded the source code as well a windows executable file.Download it and try it.Report if there are any bugs and/or any improvement is needed.
P.S: Java Runtime Environment should be preinstalled for the code to work.Also the password is automatically saved in the desktop as "password.txt",make sure that you are connected to the internet so as to recieve an email giving you the password.
Note that "E" is for encrypt and "D" is for decrypt.
